# Line Follower Simulator Architecture

## Overview

Simulation and optimization system for line follower robots that runs entirely in a web browser. The project is completely static, hosted on GitHub Pages, allowing users to create tracks, configure robots, run realistic physical simulations, and find optimal configurations through optimization algorithms.

## Project Objectives

- Enable visual creation and editing of complex tracks with curves, straights, and artifacts
- Simulate realistic robot physics considering mass, friction, temperature, pressure, and other environmental variables
- Find optimal control configurations for maximum efficiency in each track section
- Visualize competition in 3D with playback controls
- Save and share projects, tracks, and robot configurations
- Function completely offline after initial loading

## Three-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: User Interface

**Technology:** JavaScript/Svelte

**Rationale:** Svelte compiles components to optimized vanilla JavaScript with no runtime overhead, offering efficient reactivity through simple assignments, ideal for updating the UI with continuous simulation data.

**Responsibilities:**
- Visual track editor with curve and segment manipulation
- Robot and simulation parameter configuration panels
- Animation playback controls (play, pause, timeline, speed)
- Saved project management and export/import interface
- Optimization results visualization and convergence graphs

**State Management:**
- Svelte Stores for global state shared between components
- Local reactive state in each component
- Automatic synchronization with IndexedDB for persistence

### Layer 2: Simulation and Optimization

**Technology:** C++ compiled to WebAssembly via Emscripten

**Rationale:** Near-native performance (80-95%) for intensive physics and optimization calculations, with full control over memory allocation and predictable execution.

#### Physics Module

**Library:** Box2D (official WebAssembly port)

**Rationale:** Complete 2D rigid body physics engine with collision detection and stable numerical integration, eliminating the need to implement subtle stability details.

**Implementation:**
- Dynamic robot model with two independent motors (differential drive)
- Kinematics calculations considering mass, inertia, and geometry
- Friction simulation between wheels and surface
- Collision detection with track edges
- Infrared sensor system simulating analog line reading

**Environmental Factors:**
- Temperature: affects friction and motor response
- Atmospheric pressure: influences air density and drag
- Robot weight: determines inertia and grip
- Friction coefficient: varies by surface type

#### Mathematics Module

**Library:** Eigen

**Rationale:** Header-only linear algebra library that works perfectly with Emscripten, offering optimized matrix operations and solvers essential for optimization algorithms.

**Usage:**
- Vector and matrix operations for kinematic calculations
- Linear system solvers
- Geometric transformation calculations

#### Optimization Module

**Strategy:** Artifact-Based Hierarchical Decomposition

**Rationale:** Instead of optimizing the entire track as a complex global problem, the system decomposes the track into known geometric primitives (artifacts) and applies analytical or semi-analytical solutions specific to each type. This approach drastically reduces the search space, provides provably optimal solutions for known cases, and enables interpretability of applied strategies.

##### Phase 1: Pattern Recognition

**Pattern Recognizer:** Analyzes track geometry and identifies known artifacts.

**Artifacts Supported in Library:**
- Simple straight: linear segment without curvature
- Circular curve: circle arc with constant radius
- Straight-curve-straight transition: common sequence in racing tracks
- S-Curve: two consecutive curves in opposite directions
- Chicane: rapid sequence of alternating curves
- Hairpin: tight 180-degree turn
- Spiral: curve with continuously varying radius

**Recognition Process:**
1. Scan track segments sequentially
2. Attempt pattern matching from most specific to most generic
3. When a match is found, mark segments as part of the artifact
4. Unrecognized segments are marked as "complex artifacts" for numerical optimization

##### Phase 2: Analytical Strategy Library

Each artifact in the library has a specific optimization strategy based on established physical principles and control theory.

**Straight:**
- Strategy: accelerate to maximum robot velocity and maintain
- Instantaneous calculation, trivially optimal solution

**Circular Curve:**
- Maximum velocity: `v_max = sqrt(μ * g * R)` where μ is friction coefficient, g gravity, R radius
- Racing line: enter wide, cut apex (innermost point), exit wide to maximize effective radius
- Analytical solution based on classical vehicle dynamics

**Straight-Curve-Straight Transition:**
- Braking distance: `d = (v_initial² - v_curve²) / (2 * a_max)`
- Braking start point calculated analytically
- Strategy: brake as late as possible before curve, cut apex, accelerate as early as possible on exit
- Based on optimal racing line theory

**S-Curve and Chicane:**
- Smoothed trajectory to minimize abrupt direction changes
- Modulated velocity to maintain grip in transitions
- Uses Bézier splines or clothoids for smooth transitions

**Hairpin:**
- Very reduced velocity at apex
- Wide entry, late apex, accelerate on exit
- Calculation based on robot's minimum turning radius

**Spiral:**
- Velocity inversely proportional to local curvature
- Racing line follows varying radius
- Calculation by integration along curve

##### Phase 3: Transition Optimization

**Reduced Problem:** For N artifacts, optimize only N-1 transition velocities between consecutive artifacts.

**Approach:**
- Intelligent initialization using physical estimates
- Optimization by numerical (finite differences) or analytical gradient if available
- Problem typically with 5-15 variables (much smaller than global optimization)
- Fast convergence due to reduced search space

**Algorithm:**
1. Calculate optimal local strategy for each artifact assuming initial transition velocities
2. Optimize transition velocities to minimize total time
3. Recalculate local strategies with optimized velocities
4. Iterate until convergence (typically 3-5 iterations)

##### Phase 4: Complex Artifact Optimization

For geometries that do not fit known patterns, apply advanced numerical optimization techniques only locally to that artifact.

**Available Techniques:**

**Gradient-Based Optimization:**
- L-BFGS: quasi-Newton method without Hessian requirement, fast convergence
- Gradient Descent with momentum: for cases with noisy objective function
- Automatic Differentiation via CppAD: computes exact gradients without approximations
- Finite Differences: numerical approximation when automatic differentiation is not applicable

**Model Predictive Control (MPC):**
- Repeatedly solves finite-horizon optimization problem
- Suitable for artifacts with complex constraints or variable geometry
- Allows incorporation of future state prediction
- Used in modern automotive control and mobile robotics systems

**Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP):**
- For nonlinear problems with equality and inequality constraints
- Approximates problem locally by quadratic program
- Superlinear convergence when close to solution

**Direct Collocation:**
- Discretizes trajectory into control points
- Transforms optimal control problem into nonlinear parameter optimization
- Effective for complex trajectories with multiple constraints

**Shooting Methods:**
- Integrates dynamics equations forward with candidate controls
- Adjusts controls to satisfy boundary conditions
- Single shooting (simple) or Multiple shooting (more robust)

**Fallback - Stochastic Algorithms:**
Only when deterministic methods fail due to multiple local minima:
- Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO): generally faster than GA
- Genetic Algorithm: robust but computationally expensive
- Simulated Annealing: for highly non-convex search spaces

##### Optimizable Parameters

**Artifact Level:**
- Entry and exit velocities
- Braking/acceleration start points
- Trajectory (racing line) for curves
- Maneuver aggressiveness

**Global Level:**
- PID controller gains (Kp, Ki, Kd) via established tuning methods (Ziegler-Nichols, Cohen-Coon)
- Maximum robot velocity in different environmental conditions
- Safety margins (minimum distance from edges)

##### Objective Function

**Primary:** Total time to complete track

**Secondary (weighted):**
- Trajectory smoothness: penalizes abrupt accelerations and oscillations
- Energy consumption: integral of power along path
- Safety margin: penalizes excessive proximity to edges
- Mechanical wear: penalizes maneuvers that stress components

##### Advantages of Artifact-Based Approach

**Computational Efficiency:**
- 80-95% reduction in number of variables to optimize
- Analytical solutions are instantaneous (microseconds)
- Numerical optimization applied only where necessary

**Interpretability:**
- User sees specific strategy applied to each artifact
- Detailed feedback: "In this 8m radius curve, limited by grip to 1.2 m/s"
- Educational value about vehicle dynamics and racing strategies

**Robustness:**
- Analytical solutions are provably optimal within physical constraints
- No risk of convergence to poor local minima in known artifacts
- Deterministic and reproducible results

**Scalability:**
- Artifact library can grow incrementally
- Advanced users can contribute new artifacts
- Each artifact is independent testable module

#### Operating Modes

**Batch Mode (Optimization):**
- Executes thousands of complete simulations without visualization
- Returns only final results (fitness, time, parameters)
- Optimized for maximum execution speed
- Runs in Web Worker to not block interface

**Step Mode (Visualization):**
- Advances simulation incrementally synchronized with animation
- Returns complete state at each step (position, velocity, sensors)
- Generates complete state log for later playback
- Allows fine control of simulation rate

**Playback System:**
- Simulation runs independently generating complete state log
- Animation reproduces log synchronized with browser clock time
- Controls: play, pause, stop, timeline scrubbing

- Optimized storage via keyframes with interpolation

**Performance Optimization:**
- Instanced rendering for repetitive track elements
